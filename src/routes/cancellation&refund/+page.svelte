    ADDY FITNESS believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has
    therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc font-[Lato] pl-10 gap-10">
    <li>
      Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately
      after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be
      entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants
      and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
    </li>
    <li>
      ADDY FITNESS does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items
      like flowers, eatables etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the
      customer establishes that the quality of product delivered is not good.
    </li>
    <li>
      In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same to
      our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be entertained once
      the merchant has checked and determined the same at his own end. This
      should be reported within 7 days of receipt of the products.
    </li>
    <li>
      In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or
      as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer
      service within 7 days of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team
      after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision.
    </li>
    <li>
      In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from
      manufacturers, please refer the issue to them.
    </li>
    <li>
      In case of any Refunds approved by the ADDY FITNESS, itâ€™ll take 3-5 days
      for the refund to be processed to the end customer.
    </li>
  </ul>
